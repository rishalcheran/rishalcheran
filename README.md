I'm a data analyst and love to learn to code the fun way. Incoming undergraduate student studying computer science engineering. I've always had a great interest in how computers work in general but when I saw the scale of what can be done on the internet I've always wondered how it's done and boom!. I enjoy travelling and street photography, it takes me off the hook for a while ðŸš€
